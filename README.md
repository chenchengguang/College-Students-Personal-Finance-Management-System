# College-Students-Personal-Finance-Management-System
Portable intelligent devices are more and more popular in daily life,  enabling users to work on e-files and complex computing  anywhere. College students may be busy with study or other tasks and forget to manage their various bills on time. In the environment of Android system’s rapid growth, developing a personal finance system based on Android can not only help users recording and getting personal property information more conveniently, but also enhance undergraduate's sense of financial security. In this paper we design a personal finance management application with the characteristics of beautiful interface, easy operation and practical function. The system mainly adopts the object-oriented design method, using Android Studio2.3 as the development platform, Java as the development language and the SQLite database operated by LitePal as the background database. The application includes several functional modules: accounts management, income and expenditures management, plans management and periodical payments management. These can meet the college students’ requirements of reasonable financial management of personal property.
